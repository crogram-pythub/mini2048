#mini2048
========
A Python implementation of 2048 with a minimum GUI in 99 Physical LOC

Not Pythonic, PEP8 is not followed. I wrote this code because I'm boring.

Two modules are included:

1) Game control module. Based on numpy, use a 2d ndarray to store the tile values. It takes input of UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT to step forward. 

2) A minimum GUI based on Tk. The color style is referred to <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048">gabrielecirulli/2048</a></p>.
